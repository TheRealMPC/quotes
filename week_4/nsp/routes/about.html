              The original idea for this project was to incorporate the Google Maps API in order to show location markers on a map to many KC BBQ restaurants. As the project grew, so did the scope of the project and time started to stretch thin for this project. What is displayed on the page now is only a beta version of the original project.

              While I had the maps working just fine on the index page, I was having issues getting them to work on the route page I had moved them to. Correcting these issues would not have been impossible in the time fram but they may have hindered progress and would not have allowed a working project to be presented.

            Though I don't believe it will take long to fix the original version of this project (which I will do on my own time), there are a few other features I would like to add. I would like to be able to add new restaurants to the database and I had been looking into Google authentication in order to have an account system to mark off which restaurants had been visited.
